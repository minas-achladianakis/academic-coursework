# 📚 Academic Coursework

Welcome to my academic coursework repository! This space includes selected assignments, projects, and exercises from my graduate studies in **Applied Mathematics**, **Data Science**, and **Artificial Intelligence**.

## 👨‍🎓 About Me

I'm a dedicated graduate student at the **University of Crete**'s Department of Applied Mathematics, with a Bachelor in theoretical math and a passion for continuous learning and growth. My academic journey has sharpened my critical thinking, problem-solving, and computational modeling skills.  

Currently, I am finalizing my **Master’s thesis** on **Expectation Maximization (EM) variants** that resemble the **Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES)** — an effort positioned within the field of **Black-Box Optimization**. I'm also exploring potential job and research opportunities.

## 📂 What's Inside

This repository is structured by topic, with subfolders that group content from different university-level courses:

- **Bayesian Statistics (Hoff)**  
- **Statistical Learning**  
- **Computational Statistics**  
- **Numerical Methods**  
- **Dynamical Systems**  
- **AI & ML Courses**  
- **Book-Based Exercises**  
- **Miscellaneous Coursework**

Each section includes either code (in Python, R, Jupyter, or LaTeX), solutions, or write-ups — with full credit to referenced sources.

## 🔐 Useful Snippets & Tools

In addition to coursework, I will also upload **practical tools** that may help others manage or protect their academic work. For example:

- 🛡️ **Protect Your Work Script** – A simple PDF-to-image-to-PDF tool that flattens content, making it harder to extract or modify sensitive academic material. Ideal for submitting protected solutions or sharing limited-access work.

These scripts are available in the root or tools folders and will include clear instructions.

## 🚧 Under Construction

As this repository continues to grow, expect more polished uploads, refined solutions, and practical utilities to appear over time. Contributions and feedback are welcome.
