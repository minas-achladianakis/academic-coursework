# 📌 Bayesian Statistics – *A First Course in Bayesian Statistical Methods*  
This section contains solutions, notes, and additional insights based on Peter D. Hoff’s book *A First Course in Bayesian Statistical Methods*. It serves as a personal archive from a graduate reading course focused on deepening understanding of Hoff’s book, with the majority of exercises drawn directly from it. Supplementary material from other sources is also included where relevant.  

Topics covered include:  
- Bayesian inference and prior/posterior distributions  
- Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods  
- Hierarchical models and Bayesian regression  
- Computational techniques for Bayesian analysis

⚠️ **Note:** The exercises in this archive are labeled differently than in Peter D. Hoff’s textbook.  
The correct exercise numbers (as they appear in Hoff’s book) are listed at the end of each page of the exercise description for reference.

### 📘 Part 1 – Bayesian_Statistics_Part1 (Uploaded as PDF)

The first element of this section is a compiled PDF of my work during the course. The material is organized into labeled tasks, each corresponding to specific exercises and references:

- **Task 1 (pp. 10–14):**  
  Introductory exercises, not from Hoff’s book.

- **Task 2 (pp. 15–30):**  
  Exercises 3.2, 3.3, 3.7, 3.8 from Hoff.

- **Task 3 (pp. 31–47):**  
  Two custom exercises and Hoff’s 3.9, 3.10, 3.12.

- **Task 4 (pp. 48–end):**  
  Problem 3.4 from *Applied Bayesian Statistics With R and OpenBUGS* by M.K. Cowles, and Hoff’s 4.2, 4.3, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8.


### 📘 Part 2 – Bayesian_Statistics_Part2 (Uploaded as PDF)

The second element of this section is a compiled PDF of my work during the course. The material is organized into labeled tasks, each corresponding to specific exercises and references:

- **Task 5 (pp. 1–18):**  
  Hoff’s exercises 3.4, 3.5, and 4.4.

- **Task 6 (pp. 19–37):**  
  Hoff’s exercises 5.1–5.4.

- **Task 7 (pp. 38–56):**  
  Three custom exercises and Hoff’s 5.5, 6.1.

- **Task 8 (pp. 56–end):**  
  One basic exercise and Hoff’s 7.3.

Future uploads will include follow-up parts structured in the same manner.
