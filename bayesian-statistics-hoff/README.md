# ðŸ“Œ Bayesian Statistics â€“ *A First Course in Bayesian Statistical Methods*  
This section contains solutions, notes, and additional insights based on Peter D. Hoffâ€™s book *A First Course in Bayesian Statistical Methods*. It serves as a personal archive from a graduate reading course focused on deepening understanding of Hoffâ€™s book, with the majority of exercises drawn directly from it. Supplementary material from other sources is also included where relevant.  

Topics covered include:  
- Bayesian inference and prior/posterior distributions  
- Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods  
- Hierarchical models and Bayesian regression  
- Computational techniques for Bayesian analysis

### ðŸ“˜ Part 1 â€“ Archive Overview (Uploaded as PDF)

The first element of this section is a compiled PDF of my initial work during the course. The material is organized into labeled tasks, each corresponding to specific exercises and references:

- **Task 1 (pp. 10â€“14):**  
  Introductory exercises, not from Hoffâ€™s book.

- **Task 2 (pp. 15â€“30):**  
  Exercises 3.2, 3.3, 3.7, 3.8 from Hoff.

- **Task 3 (pp. 31â€“47):**  
  Two custom exercises and Hoffâ€™s 3.9, 3.10, 3.12.

- **Task 4 (pp. 48â€“75):**  
  Problem 3.4 from *Applied Bayesian Statistics With R and OpenBUGS* by M.K. Cowles, and Hoffâ€™s 4.2, 4.3, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8.

- **Task 5 (pp. 76â€“102):**  
  Hoffâ€™s exercises 3.4, 3.5, and 4.4.

- **Task 6 (pp. 103â€“122):**  
  Hoffâ€™s exercises 5.1â€“5.4.

- **Task 7 (pp. 123â€“141):**  
  Three custom exercises and Hoffâ€™s 5.5, 6.1.

- **Task 8 (pp. 141â€“end):**  
  One basic exercise and Hoffâ€™s 7.3.

Future uploads will include follow-up parts structured in the same manner.
