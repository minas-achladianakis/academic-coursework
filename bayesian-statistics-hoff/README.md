# 📌 Bayesian Statistics – *A First Course in Bayesian Statistical Methods*  
This section contains solutions, notes, and additional insights based on Peter D. Hoff’s book *A First Course in Bayesian Statistical Methods*. It serves as a personal archive from a graduate reading course focused on deepening understanding of Hoff’s book, with the majority of exercises drawn directly from it. Supplementary material from other sources is also included where relevant.  

Topics covered include:  
- Bayesian inference and prior/posterior distributions  
- Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods  
- Hierarchical models and Bayesian regression  
- Computational techniques for Bayesian analysis

⚠️ **Note:** The exercises in this archive are labeled differently than in Peter D. Hoff’s textbook.  
The correct exercise numbers (as they appear in Hoff’s book) are listed at the end of each page of the exercise description for reference.

  📘 Part 4 – Final Exercise: Metropolis for Logistic Regression
📎 [View PDF](./Bayesian_Statistics_Part4.pdf)

The final exercise of the reading course is based on Exercise 10.2 from Peter D. Hoff’s book and focuses on Bayesian logistic regression using the Metropolis algorithm for MCMC sampling. It provides a full walk-through from model definition and prior selection to posterior sampling and diagnostics.

Bayesian model setup for binary response data on sparrow nesting

- Exploratory prior specification using contour plots for 
- Implementation of the Metropolis algorithm for non-conjugate posteriors
- Burn-in and acceptance rate tuning (comparison of 10k vs. 100k iterations)
- Posterior summaries, trace plots, and effective sample size calculations
- Construction of Bayesian credible bands around the fitted logistic curve
- Comparison of posterior and prior densities and convergence diagnostics

📌 This task is a complete MCMC implementation in R for Bayesian logistic regression using real ecological data and serves as a hands-on application of concepts from Chapter 10 in Hoff.
